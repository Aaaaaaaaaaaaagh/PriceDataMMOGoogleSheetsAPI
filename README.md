# PriceDataMMOGoogleSheetsAPI
Hey, prospective employer, hope you're doing well :) so, I code, I just never post to my github because I'm terribly unorganized if I'm not working with others. But I still code or look at code as a hobby, I just haven't been building out big things since I graduated college. But this is something older that I've been meaning to post. This is an API function and set of code I cobbled together to allow for me to pull pricing data from an online API (That has since been rate limited) into a set of values and fields that look at the arbitrage prices between different locations that sell those items. In this game (Albion Online, for reference), I would use this data to flip inventory amounts from one city to another, netting me a significant chunk of in-game money. I have small other scripts of my own creation that do this for things in real life, but I don't feel comfortable posting those, as they generate me income.
